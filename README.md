## Shuffle Algorithms

Shuffify provides multiple algorithms for different use cases. See [app/utils/shuffle_algorithms/README.md](app/utils/shuffle_algorithms/README.md) for detailed documentation.

### Quick Overview
- **Basic Shuffle**: Standard random shuffle with fixed start option
- **Vibe Shuffle**: Creates smooth transitions using audio features
- **Balanced Shuffle**: Ensures fair representation from all playlist parts
- **Percentage Shuffle**: Shuffles only a portion of the playlist

## Development Workflow

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   # For development:
   pip install -r requirements/dev.txt
   
   # For production:
   pip install -r requirements/prod.txt
   ```
4. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure
5. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```

### Requirements Management

The project uses a structured requirements approach:
- `requirements/base.txt`: Core dependencies needed by both development and production
- `requirements/dev.txt`: Additional development tools (testing, linting, etc.)
- `requirements/prod.txt`: Production-specific dependencies (e.g., gunicorn)

When adding new dependencies:
1. Add core dependencies to `base.txt`
2. Add development tools to `dev.txt`
3. Add production-specific packages to `prod.txt`

### Docker Development

```bash
# Build and start containers
docker-compose up --build
```

## Deployment

### Production (DigitalOcean)
1. Set up environment variables in DigitalOcean
2. Deploy using Docker:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

### Development (Local)
1. Use local `.env` file
2. Run with Docker or Python directly

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Frontend**: Tailwind CSS
- **Authentication**: Spotify OAuth
- **Deployment**: Digital Ocean App Platform
- **Container**: Docker
- **WSGI Server**: Gunicorn

## Architecture

The application follows a clean architecture pattern with the following components:

```
shuffify/
â”œâ”€â”€ app/                    # Application package
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py        # App initialization
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ routes.py          # URL routes and views
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ spotify/           # Spotify API handling
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ client.py      # Spotify client wrapper
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ utils/             # Utility functions
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ shuffify.py    # Playlist shuffling logic
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ templates/         # HTML templates
â”œâ”€â”€ config.py              # Configuration settings
â””â”€â”€ run.py                # WSGI entry point
```
